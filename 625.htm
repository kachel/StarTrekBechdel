Four of Twelve, subjunction of Unimatrix five two five. You have a
disease. You're one of many with this sickness. We want to cure you but
we need a better way to identify those with the mutation. Our testing
method is too slow. It could take centuries to identify everyone. Help
me find the interlink frequency that binds all of you together. Then we
can put an end to this, quickly, efficiently. Comply. <br>(The drone gasps as if being strangled.)<br>QUEEN: I've disconnected
you from the hive mind. You're alone. I know how uncomfortable that can
be. Tell me what I want to know. tThen you can rejoin us. <br>
DRONE: I don't know. <br>
QUEEN: You must remember something. <br>
DRONE: I don't remember. <br>

Another milestone. You've had your first dream. <br>
SEVEN: I felt awake. <br>
EMH: Dreams can often seem quite real. Tell me more about this forest. <br>
SEVEN: It was familiar. <br>
EMH: Perhaps your unconscious mind was drawing on a childhood memory. <br>
SEVEN: I spoke to someone. He called me by my human name. <br>
EMH: Did you recognise him? <br>
SEVEN: He seemed familiar. <br>
EMH: This could give us a fascinating glimpse into your unconscious
mind. Any one of those images might have a symbolic meaning. The
mysterious stranger, for example. Is he a father figure or does he
represent a repressed desire for male companionship? <br>
SEVEN: I don't wish to dream again. Please repair my cortical array. <br>
EMH: This isn't a malfunction, Seven, it's a natural step in your human
development. It might seem unsettling now, but you'll get used to it.

You're late, Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS: Ma'am? <br>
TUVOK: According to the ship's chronometer, by twenty two seconds. <br>
PARIS: I'll make it up at the end of my shift. <br>
CHAKOTAY: See that you do. <br>
JANEWAY: Take your station. <br>(There is a small box on the helmsman's chair. Behind his back, Janeway is grinning broadly.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Open it, that's an order. Not only late but improperly
dressed. That belongs on your collar, Mister Paris. <br>
JANEWAY: Allow me. As ship's captain, I hereby reinstate you to the
rank of Lieutenant, with all the privileges and responsibilities
therein. Your performance on this ship over the past year has been
exemplary. I expect more of the same. <br>
PARIS: You won't be disappointed. <br>
TORRES: Congratulations, Lieutenant. <br>
KIM: I didn't notice a little box on my chair. <br>(Beep!)<br>
PARIS: Hiding a cake in the console? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like a distress call. <br>
JANEWAY: Put it through. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm getting a carrier wave but no message. <br>
JANEWAY: Origin? <br>
TUVOK: An asteroid approximately two light years from here. <br>
JANEWAY: Yellow alert. Set a course. <br>(Later -)<br>PARIS:
We're in range. <br>
JANEWAY: Drop to impulse. On screen. Magnify. <br>
TUVOK: I'm reading artificial structures. It's a colony of some kind. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. This is Captain Janeway of the starship
Voyager. We received your distress call. <br>(The metallic domes and other buildings have scorch marks on them.) <br>JANEWAY: Lifesigns? <br>
TUVOK: None. <br>
KIM: I'm detecting residual weapons signatures. They're Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: Any vessels? <br>
TUVOK: One. A Cube at the edge of this system. <br>
JANEWAY: Resume our previous course, Mister Paris, warp six. Make a
note in the ship's record. We responded to a distress call at oh nine
hundred hours. Arrived at the colony two hours later. No survivors. We
don't know who these people were, but we know the Borg destroyed them. <br>(Seven
stands in front of her alcove, hesitating. Then she puts the EMH's

Come with me. <br>
SEVEN: I'm regenerating. This is only a dream. <br>
AXUM: You're not dreaming. I brought you here. This is Unimatrix Zero. <br>
SEVEN: There is no Unimatrix Zero. Who are you? <br>
AXUM: Five of Twelve, secondary adjunct of Trimatrix nine four two. But
when I'm here my name is Axum. <br>
SEVEN: Axum. <br>
AXUM: Sound familiar? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
AXUM: Good. It's starting to come back to you. <br>
ALIEN CHILD: Is anyone here? <br>
AXUM: Hello. <br>
ALIEN CHILD: I think I'm lost. <br>(The child looks very like the humanoids from Muse, but they didn't have space technology.)<br>
AXUM: I'm Axum. This is Annika. <br>
ALIEN CHILD: My father's ship started shaking. Men came aboard. They
looked like machines. Will you help me find my father? <br>AXUM: I'll see
what I can do. There are other children here. Would you like to meet
them? <br>
SEVEN: I just got here, too. This environment is intimidating, but I
believe it's safe. <br>(The boy goes ahead of them.)<br>SEVEN: He was just assimilated. <br>
AXUM: He's probably still in a maturation chamber. <br>
SEVEN: Are you telling me this isn't a real place?&nbsp;It's some kind of
virtual construct?. <br>
AXUM: We come here during our regeneration cycles. We can exist as
individuals here. <br>(They look out over an inlet.)<br>
SEVEN: Unimatrix Zero. <br>
AXUM: You used to come here, before you escaped the Collective. You have
the recessive mutation, too. Don't you remember any of it? <br>
SEVEN: No. What mutation? <br>
AXUM: Only one out of a million drones has it. <br>
SEVEN: Why did you bring me here now? <br>
AXUM: The Collective has found a way to detect us. It's a lengthy
procedure, but they've managed to identify and deactivate nearly two
hundred of us over the last few months. It's only a matter of time
before they find enough of us to isolate the interlink frequency. Once
they've done that. You can help us stop them. <br>
SEVEN: Clarify. <br>
AXUM: We've designed a nanovirus that should mask the biochemical
signature of the mutation, but we need someone to release it into the
Collective. <br>
SEVEN: You're already on a Borg vessel. Why don't you do it? <br>
AXUM: After we've completed our regeneration cycle we have no memory of
this place. You are not a part of the Collective anymore. You're our
only connection to the real world. </font></p>

Scan the node for residual harmonics. It's a shame you're not alive to
experience disembodiment. It's the epitome of perfection. Give it to
me. We have isolated the carrier band but it's useless to us without
the precise frequency. We need additional data. Two more of the
mutations have been discovered in spatial grid six four nine. Have
their cortical nodes removed and analysed. Bring me the results. </font></p>

Unimatrix Zero is our sanctuary. When we're here, our thoughts are our
own. <br>
SEVEN: What was my function?. <br>
AXUM: You're thinking like a Borg. Our only function here is to try and
regain a fragment of the lives we lost when we were assimilated. <br>
ALIEN CHILD: Mister Axum? <br>
AXUM: Go introduce yourself. They won't mind. <br>
GIRL: Hello, do you want to play? <br>
ALIEN CHILD: Sure. &nbsp;<br>(An alien man appears.)<br>
LAURA: Siral, over here. I was hoping you'd come. It's great to see
you. <br>(He is hugged by a human woman.)<br>
SIRAL: It's always good to be back. <br>
SEVEN: I remember him. <br>
AXUM: You were friends. You knew a lot of people here. You were a part
of our lives for eighteen years. <br>
SEVEN: I'm willing to help, but I can't do it alone. I'm part of a
starship crew now. I'll have to inform my Captain. <br>(The Klingon warrior approaches them.<br>
KOROK: I told you not to bring her here. <br>
AXUM: We can't do this by ourselves. <br>
KOROK: It's too great a risk. <br>
AXUM: We don't have a choice. <br>
KOROK: You do not speak for all of us. <br>
AXUM: What would you rather do? Have us wait until we're all
discovered? You disappoint me. Where's your warrior spirit? <br>
KOROK: PetaQ! I'll rip your heart out. <br>
AXUM: Go ahead, kill me. I'll be back when I begin my next regeneration
cycle. You can't stop me, Korok. <br>
KOROK: If you come here again, you'll be putting your starship at risk
and all of us as well. <br>
LAURA: Shouldn't you be off sharpening your teeth? <br>(Korok leaves.)<br>
SEVEN: I know you. Your name is Laura. You're human. <br>
LAURA: I was assimilated at Wolf three five nine. It's good to see you
again. But you look out of place. Your cybernetic implants. <br>
SEVEN: Our Doctor was unable to remove all of my Borg components. <br>
AXUM: You don't have to look that way here. <br>
SEVEN: My appearance is irrelevant. <br>
AXUM: No, it's not. They may have turned us into drones, but they can't
change the essence of who we are. My cycle's about to end. Talk to your captain. We can't do this without <br>(Axum steps out of his alcove, a drone again.) </font></p>

Another round with the Borg? <br>
SEVEN: We'd only need to infiltrate a single vessel. <br>
PARIS: Oh, just one? <br>
SEVEN: I am prepared to take a shuttle and do this alone. <br>
KIM: No offence, but how do you know that this wasn't some kind of a
dream? <br>
EMH: Seven was wearing a cortical monitor. She never reached REM sleep.
She wasn't dreaming. <br>
SEVEN: Unimatrix Zero is real, and so are the people who go there. They
need our help. <br>
JANEWAY: What else can you tell us about this place? How many drones? <br>
SEVEN: No one is certain. Axum told me there could be tens of <br>
JANEWAY: Axum? <br>
SEVEN: He's someone I used to know. He told me there could be tens of
thousands, perhaps more. <br>
JANEWAY: How was it created? <br>
SEVEN: Some of them believe it began as a random malfunction during the
assimilation of a single drone, and eventually spread to the others. <br>
TORRES: Well, this is all very interesting, but are we sure it's worth
putting our lives on the line? <br>
SEVEN: It's my understanding that when we receive a distress call, we
respond. Starfleet protocols. <br>
KIM: She's right. This is no different. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand your reluctance, but Seven's discovered a
potential weakness in the Collective. Before we decide how to proceed
I'd like to learn as much about it as we can. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Too bad you don't have the luxury of an interlink node. <br>
TUVOK: There is another possibility. A Vulcan technique known as the
bridging of minds. <br>
JANEWAY: Go on. <br>
TUVOK: I would need to initiate a mind meld with both you and Seven,
acting as a telepathic conduit. <br>
EMH: You make it sound like a conference call. Captain, it is my
professional opinion that we wait until <br>

Stay at Yellow alert. Maintain long-range scans for Borg vessels. Any
sign of trouble, you know where to find me. <br>

mind, I had a headache for two weeks. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm willing to volunteer if you'd rather hold down the fort. <br>

many times have you actually performed this bridging of heads? <br>
TUVOK: Minds. Never. <br>
EMH: Then how can you be certain it'll work? <br>
TUVOK: Nothing is certain, Doctor. However, I once observed a Vulcan
master perform the technique. I am reasonably confident I can duplicate
his success. <br>
EMH: Watching and doing are two different things. <br>
TUVOK: As always, your logic is impeccable. <br>
EMH: What a comfort. <br>
TUVOK: We're ready, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's do it. <br>(The EMH puts a gizmo on Janeway's neck and she steps up into an alcove.)<br>
TUVOK: As the conduit, I'll be aware of both your perceptions. If
something goes wrong, I'll break the meld. <br>

JANEWAY: We're prepared to help you, but I'm concerned that we'd only be
putting off the inevitable. Even if we succeeded and you could remain
hidden for a year, ten years, the Borg would eventually find you again.
Have you ever considered a more permanent solution? <br>
AXUM: More permanent? <br>
JANEWAY: You've got a remarkable sanctuary here, but that's all it is.
Maybe it's time to stop hiding and find a way to fight back. <br>
AXUM: That's not possible. <br>
JANEWAY: If you could find a way to carry your individualities into the
real world, to wake up from your regeneration cycles with your memories
intact, you could begin to undermine the Borg's control over you. <br>
SEVEN: It sounds like you're suggesting a civil war. <br>
JANEWAY: I prefer to call it a resistance movement. <br>

JANEWAY: The people there are vulnerable. They don't have the ability
to take action in the real world. We're going to give them that
ability. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How? <br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor and B'Elanna are working on it. I know what you're
thinking. We'd be violating half a dozen Starfleet protocols. And if the
Collective ever learned we were involved we'd be putting Voyager in the
middle of a civil war. Valid objections. Chakotay, we've had our
disagreements and there have been times when I've chosen to proceed
without your support. But this can't be one of those times. I won't do
this without my First Officer. <br>

price to pay. If we help these people, this could be the turning point
in our battle against the Borg. <br>

This is the nanovirus Axum designed to prevent the Borg from detecting
those with the genetic mutation. But I've modified it to nullify their

their memories of Unimatrix Zero after they leave their alcoves. <br>

up to the Collective? <br>
EMH: There's no way to tell. This is highly experimental. <br>
JANEWAY: How do we deploy it? <br>
TORRES: Correct me if I'm wrong, but each Borg vessel has a device that
links it to every other Borg ship. <br>
SEVEN: The central plexus. <br>
TORRES: If we can gain access to one of those and release the virus
there, it should be transmitted throughout the Collective instantly. <br>
JANEWAY: Any Borg activity in the region? <br>(Torres calls up a long range scan 321.)<br>
TORRES: It just dropped out of transwarp three point six light years
from here. <br>

plexus is protected by multi-regenerative security grids. We'd be

Who knows? You may even get to meet him in person someday. <br>(Seven steps into her alcove.)<br>
EMH: I'll say this for your Mister Axum. he's a very lucky man. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> AXUM:
The Collective has found a new way to attack us. Eleven ships have
self-destructed in the last three hours. <br>
KOROK: We need to coordinate a battle plan. A way to strike at the
heart of the Collective. <br>
AXUM: Our target should be the primary Unicomplex. If we can disrupt
the Queen's control of the hive mind, it'll give us a chance to
organise, build up a fighting force. <br>
SEVEN: There is one more objective. The Voyager away team. <br>
KOROK: They fought like warriors. Their sacrifice will not be
forgotten. <br>
SEVEN: We can still rescue them. <br>
AXUM: She's right. They risked their lives for us. Now it's our turn. <br>
KOROK: There's no time. <br>
AXUM: It's a matter of honour, Korok. I thought you of all people would
understand that. <br>
KOROK: I'll see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs. <br>
SEVEN: Thank you. <br>
AXUM: It's the least we can do. <br>
SEVEN: What's wrong? <br>
AXUM: It turns out I'm on a scout ship patrolling the border of fluidic
space. On the other side of the galaxy. <br>
SEVEN: I was hoping we'd be able to meet one day in the real world. <br>
AXUM: Me too. There are things I can do where I am. I'll try to contact
species 8472, see if I can persuade them to join the fight. <br>
SEVEN: Given their history with the Borg, I'm sure they'll be eager. I
guess this rules out Vorothon Gorge. <br>
AXUM: Gorge? <br>
SEVEN: It was at the top of our list of things to see in the real world
if we were ever freed from the Collective. Don't you remember? <br>
AXUM: We could add fluidic space to our list. We still have Unimatrix
Zero. <br>
SEVEN: It was sufficient before. <br>
AXUM: And now? <br>(Seven takes his hand, and they kiss.)

ALIEN BOY: They said you want to assim. Assima. <br>
QUEEN: Assimilate you. Yes. But that's nothing to be afraid of. You
like having friends, don't you? Assimilation turns us all into friends.
In fact, it brings us so close together we can hear each other's
thoughts. <br>
ALIEN BOY: Is that fun? <br>
QUEEN: Yes. It's fun. I was just about your age when I was assimilated.
I was worried then, too. But when I began to hear the others, hear
their thoughts, I wasn't afraid anymore. <br>
ALIEN BOY: Don't you miss your parents? <br>
QUEEN: They're here, with me. Part of us. I can hear them right now.
Would you like to be with your parents? They miss you. They want to see
you. <br>

took your advice, Captain. I paid a visit to Unimatrix Zero. It's far
more primitive than I expected. I don't understand how anyone could
prefer a crude environment to Borg perfection. <br>HOLO-JANEWAY: Spend a little more time there. You might find out. <br>
QUEEN: I've seen enough. It's an illusion. <br>HOLO-JANEWAY: Even so, the people who go there are real, and they won't give
it up without a fight. <br>
QUEEN: They'll fail. I thought you'd like to see our latest
accomplishment. Recognise it? <br>HOLO-JANEWAY: No. <br>
QUEEN: I think you do. It's your nanovirus, with a few modifications.
We've reprogrammed it to target your mutated drones. Once it's released,
it will erode their autonomic functions. They will die within minutes. <br>HOLO-JANEWAY: You have no way to deliver it. Those drones have been
separated from the hive mind. They aren't linked to the central plexus
anymore. <br>
QUEEN: No. But there's another way I can reach them. I'm prepared to go
back to Unimatrix Zero and release it myself. But I'm willing to
reconsider. It all depends on you. <br>
JANEWAY: Me? <br>
QUEEN: If they rejoin the Collective, I'll spare their lives. They
listen to you. Tell them it's time to come home. You were responsible
for many deaths. Now you can save thousands. Decide. </font></p>
