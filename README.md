Star Trek + Bechdel Test
========================

In this project, I am endeavoring to make a program that evaluates which episodes of Star Trek pass the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test).

## Hypothesis

Voyager will have the most episodes that pass.
TOS will have the least.

## Process

- Data Scraping script websites + [Star Trek API](stapi.co)
- Data Analysis (trying to avoid NLP)
- Data Visualization (using D3)

## This is my first ever programming project

Wish me luck! Though I have never done this before, I am excited to get started. The secondary goal of this project is to familiarize myself with JavaScript (and a few select libraries), HTML, CSS, and APIs.
